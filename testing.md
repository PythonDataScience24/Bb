## Testing

We tested the filter functionallity of the backend to ensure that the backend performs the correct filtering. Filtering can be a very error prone operation. Thus its important to test many diffrent filter keywords and check if the correct output is provided by the function. For example the filter function in the backend could output wrong matches or no matches at all. Or all matches if an empty string is provided which would also be wrong according to our usecase.
